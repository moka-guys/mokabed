# Pan4398
This BED file is used to calculate coverage for the VCP1 Panel. This was previously created in Pan4302, but a mistake was found in the mapping of one of the LAMA2 exons. Therefore, a copy of those files were made and manually edited.

The incorrect coordinates are:
incorrect coordinates - chr6:129763337-129763402
correct coordinates - chr6:129764177-129764243


## take copies of Pan4302data.bed and Pan4302dataSambamba.bed
`cp Pan4302data.bed Pan4398data.bed`
`cp Pan4302dataSambamba.bed Pan4398dataSambamba.bed`
