This BED file contains additional variants for that will be analysed using VCP2 panel.

This is version 1 of this list of variants.

The coordinates for this BED file were provided by the monogenics team after consulting the Slice document provided by NHSE and with scientists in charge of these tests.

The coordinates were manually converted into BED file 
The position quoted in the coordinates was used as the stop coord and the start pos was this coord -1.
These positions were then further padded +/-5bp
Positions were checked in UCSC by adding the BED file as a track

Note: RS id was not available for this BRCA1 variant

Add extra line at the end of the file

Further changes were made to ensure whitespace (tabs/vs spaces) were consistent
