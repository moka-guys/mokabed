The benchmarking tool is being updated to handle build 38, this requires a new default bedfile to use with bams aligned to build 38.
The current default b37 bedfile, as defined in the apps config file, is agilent_sureselect_human_all_exon_v5_b37_targets.bed (project-ByfFPz00jy1fk6PjpZ95F27J:file-F25VXZj0ybjzxpg0JvppGgQq).  
I couldn't find instructions for how this file was created so I downloaded the file v5 SureSelect bedfiles from the agilent website and compared them to agilent_sureselect_human_all_exon_v5_b37_targets.bed using diff.
I could convert the file S04380110_hs_hg19/S04380110_Regions.bed into agilent_sureselect_human_all_exon_v5_b37_targets.bed via three steps:

i) Convert chrom from Chr1 fromat to 1 format.
ii) Remove the two line header
iii) select only the first 3 columns

I accessed the Agilent SureDesign Website - https://earray.chem.agilent.com/suredesign/home.htm -(Account required) and downloaded the v5 Build 38 bedfiles.

I copied S04380110_Regions.bed from the unzipped folder S04380110_hs_hg38 into this repo (as it is over 100mb in size this file cannot be added to version control).

Convert to three column format using bioawk and rename file (resulting file is < 100mb and can be added to version control):
head -n 4 S04380110_Regions.bed # original file
    browser position chr1:65510-65625
    track name="Target Regions" description="Agilent SureSelect DNA - SureSelectXT Human All Exon V5 - This is same as Covered.bed" color=0,0,128 db=hg38
    chr1    65509   65625   ens|ENST00000641515,mRNA|AK057951,mRNA|AL137714
    chr1    65831   65973   ens|ENST00000641515,mRNA|AK057951,mRNA|AL137714

# Convert to 3 column bedfile
bioawk -c bed '{ print $chrom, $start, $end}' S04380110_Regions.bed > agilent_sureselect_human_all_exon_v5_b38_targets.bed

head  -n 4 agilent_sureselect_human_all_exon_v5_b38_targets.bed # Check change
