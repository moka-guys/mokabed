# ========== Manual modifications
4 SNVs are to be included into the bedfile. These are:
rs111033640 - 9:34646583-34646586
rs199473684 - X:100654735
rs3027584 - X:100662921
rs6151429 - 22:51063477

1. Pan1159data.bed
A line for each SNV was created in Pan1159_rsID.bed

combined the bed files
#add non-header lines from Pan1159_rsID.bed
sed '/^#/ d' < Pan1159_rsID.bed >> Pan1159data.bed

# add the header lines to a sorted bed file. 
# Then sort the combined Pan1159data.bed on chr and then start in numerical order and append to the sorted.bed file
# rename the combined Pan1159data.bed to notsorted
# rename the sorted bedfile to Pan1159data.bed
sed '/^[^#]/ d' Pan1159data.bed > Pan1159data.sorted.bed; sed '/#/ d' Pan1159data.bed | sort -k1,1V -k2,2n >> Pan1159data.sorted.bed ; mv Pan1159data.bed Pan1159data.notsorted.bed; mv Pan1159data.sorted.bed Pan1159data.bed

2. Pan1159dataSambamba.bed
A line for each SNV was created in Pan1159_rsID_Sambamba.bed

#add non-header lines from Pan1159_rsID.bed
sed '/^#/ d' < Pan1159_rsID_Sambamba.bed >> Pan1159dataSambamba.bed

sort the combined bedfile inplace 
sort -k1,1V -k2,2n -o Pan1159dataSambamba.bed Pan1159dataSambamba.bed

3. Pan1159dataRefSeqFormat.txt
A line for each SNV was created in Pan1159_rsID_dataRefSeqFormat.bed

These were copied and pasted in the same order as the above bed files

# ============== Missing gene
It was noticed that due to the missing header in the input file the first gene (ACVRL1) was missing from the output.
The header line was added to the input file and mokabed re-run.
The newly created bed files have the suffix _temporary (these were commited in commit https://github.com/woook/mokabed/pull/82/commits/3651f3210cc8e3c9e061cfff3b8b8f83d621260b).
The lines for ACVRL1 were copied and pasted to the correct position in the bed file to avoid having to repeat the steps described above.
The difference in https://github.com/woook/mokabed/pull/82/commits/c20b49cd93187411a6ab7411fd110d5cdfdf54c9 show that only lines relating to ACVRL1 were affected.
