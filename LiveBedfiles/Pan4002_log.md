# Pan4002
It was noticed that Pan3612 was made incorrectly, with chromsome X incorrectly being labelled chr 23.
The old Pan number must be retired and replaced with this Pan number

Copies of the bed files were created:
`cp '/home/aled/Documents/mokabed/LiveBedfiles/Pan3612.bed' '/home/aled/Documents/mokabed/LiveBedfiles/Pan4002.bed' `

NB please see Pan3612_LogFile.txt for how Pan3612.bed was created

### correct BED file
The BED file was manually corrected
