This BED file is used for the VCP3 panel to calculate coverage and to restrict variant calling. 
SNORD118 gene was manually added to this BED file (Pan4535)

Pan4535 is based on an existing VCP3 BED file(Pan4361). For details on how Pan4361 was made, please see Pan4361_logfile.md

# Manually add SNORD118
SNORD118 gene is non-coding RNA, so doesn't have a NM number. 
The UCSC and NCBI refeq databases were checked and NR_033294.2 wasn't present in the databases. therefore the BED file couldn't be made using Mokabed.

Coordinates for SNORD118 were retrieved from UCSC chr17:8076771-8076906
The regions were padded by -10/+10bp to match the padding in Pan4361
