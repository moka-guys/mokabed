The coordinates for this BED file were provided by M Yau.

BED file request form saved in /RequestForms

The coordinates were manually converted into BED file format in Excel.
The position quoted in the coordinates was used as the stop coord and the start pos was this coord -1.
Positions were checked in UCSC by adding the data as a track and comparing the coordinate chage
One position provided related to a duplication (rather than SNV) but as these BED files are used for coverage and QC a single base description is sufficient. Should this BED file be used to restrict variants extra padding should be added.
