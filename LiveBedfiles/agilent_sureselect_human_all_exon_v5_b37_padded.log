The file agilent_sureselect_human_all_exon_v5_b37_targets.bed was used for variant calling but only contains the coordinates of the capture baits.
Dragen does not pad the targets for variant calling, therefore we have used the file S04380110_Padded.bed from suredesign, which contains the same regions +/-100bp.

1. remove 'chr'
This was done is a text editor, replacing "/nchr" with "/n"

This was done is a text editor

4. merge overlapping targets
bedtools merge -i LiveBedfiles/S04380110_Padded_3col.bed > LiveBedfiles/S04380110_Padded_3col_merged.bed 

5. rename file and delete all intermediate files
mv LiveBedfiles/S04380110_Padded_3col_merged.bed LiveBedfiles/agilent_sureselect_human_all_exon_v5_b37_padded.bed
