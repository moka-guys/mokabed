GEL sample matching service (SMS) requires samples to be aligned to build 38 reference genome. Pan4009 is a BED that will be used for the SNP Genotyping SMS pipeline. 
Pan4009 is a copy of Pan4002 but in build 38.

Save a copy of Pan4002
cp /LiveBedfiles/Pan4002.bed /LiveBedfiles/Pan4009_b37.bed

Convert Pan4009_b37 from build37 to build38 Pan4009_b38 using https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgLiftOver
Bed file was edited to the required format e.g chrN start end 

Remove rs id colum and add 'chr' prefix
awk '{print $1,$2,$3}' FS='\t' Pan4009_b37.bed| gawk 'BEGIN{FS="\t"; OFS="\t"} {$1="chr"$1; print}' > Pan4009_b37_formatted.bed

Manually submit Pan4009_b37.bed file to Liftover and save new bedfile Pan4009_b38.bed

Some SNPs in Pan4009_b38.bed were manually verified using dbSNP.

Note: The 'chr' prefix was retained in the CHROM field as it is according to GEL SMS specification.
