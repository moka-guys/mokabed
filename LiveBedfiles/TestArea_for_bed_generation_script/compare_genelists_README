##  compare_genelists.py 

Script compares genes listed in a BED file and genes listed in a BED file request form to identify missing genes.
Input files have to be in csv format

Usage: python3 script.py bedfile, transcriptfile, bedfile_column, transcriptfile_column

# How does the app work

Script reads the two csv files into a Pandas data frame and extracts the specified columns from the data frame.
The columns are then compared to find missing genes from the BED file

To identify extra genes in BED file not present in the BED file request form provide the transcript file as the first input and the bedfile as the second input file

usage: python3 script.py transcriptfile, bedfile, transcriptfile_column, bedfile_column

# Inputs
BEDfile (csv): 6 column format Chr, Start, Stop, EntrezID, Gene, Transcript
Transcript file (csv): Create a seperate csv file using the information given in the BEDfile request form. Should have two columns Gene, Transcript
bedfile_column: This is the column with gene names (Gene)
transcriptfile_column: This is the column with gene names (Gene)

# Output 
Missing genes will be printed on command line:
e.g Genes missing:
{'PCSK9', 'LDLR'}
If no genes are missing, the following statement will be printed:
Genes missing:
{nan}
