Total number of coding gene entries (counts number of NM accessions) in RefGene table = 19288
Alternative method to generate total number of coding gene entries (counts number cdsEndStat entries = cmpl) of cds in RefGene table = 19288
Total number of non-coding gene entries (counts number of NR accessions) in RefGene table = 10062
Alternative method to generate total number of non-coding gene entries (counts number cdsEndStat entries = unk) in RefGene table = 10062
Breakdown of gene symbols with NR accessions 
.Total number of coding gene entries in RefGene table with a non-coding accession = 2249
Total number of gene entries in RefGene table with a non-coding accession and no corresponding NM accession = 7813
The number of NR related genes tally: 7813 + 2249 = 10062
