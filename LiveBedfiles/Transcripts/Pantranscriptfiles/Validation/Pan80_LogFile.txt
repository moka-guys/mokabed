Tables IEMplusClinEx from the Validation database and sangervariantregions from the variants_database were joined using the command below.

Validation database and variants_database located in /home/ryank/GithubRepoLive/mokapipe/LiveBedfiles/Transcripts/Pantranscriptfiles folder

CREATE TABLE SangerConfirmedbed AS
SELECT Validation.IEMplusClinEx.* 
FROM Validation.IEMplusClinEx
JOIN variants_database.sangervariantregions
ON variants_database.sangervariantregions.chrCHR = Validation.IEMplusClinEx.Chr
AND variants_database.sangervariantregions.ChromosomePosition BETWEEN Validation.IEMplusClinEx.Start AND Validation.IEMplusClinEx.Stop

This bed file extracts the exons from the IEM and Pan81 concatanated bed file called Pan81plusIEMdata.bed which is saved in the Validation and variants_database folders in the /home/ryank/GithubRepoLive/mokapipe/LiveBedfiles/Transcripts/Pantranscriptfiles folder containing the 123 Sanger-confirmed validation variants
