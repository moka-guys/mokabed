# Pan4551
This is a BED file used to restrict variant calling within the exome depth CNV calling app. This BED file is for R229 Confirmed Fanconi anaemia or Bloom syndrome

This test consists of a number of genes, some of which had multiple transcripts.

Transcript was selected from the ngspanel genes table using the query
`select GuysAccession, Symbol, '0' as GuysAccessionVersion from ngspanelgenes where NGSPanelID=4551`
This was used to create Pan4551.txt and Pan4551_duplicates.txt, which ensured there was only transcript per gene. These were used as inputs to mokabed as below (and also Pan4551_duplicates_LogFile.txt):

## Combining multiple transcripts
Where multiple transcripts have been provided, the below BEDtools subtract command adds regions from file a not already covered in file b to the end of file b:

`bedtools subtract -a Pan4551_duplicatesdata.bed -b Pan4551data.bed >> Pan4551data.bed`

# Add intronic regions/control sites from Pan3608.bed
cat Pan3608.bed >> Pan4551data.bed

# sort bedfile
sort Pan4551data.bed -k1,1V -k2,2n -k3,3n > Pan4551_sorted.bed; mv Pan4551data.bed Pan4551_unsorted.bed; mv Pan4551_sorted.bed Pan4551data.bed; rm Pan4551_unsorted.bed

# remove header
the header was removed manually

# convert to 4 column bed file
cut -f 1-4 Pan4551data.bed > Pan4551data_4col.bed; rm Pan4551data.bed; mv Pan4551data_4col.bed Pan4551data.bed

#Rename file to make it clear that it's a CNV BED 
mv Pan4551data.bed Pan4551_CNV.bed

# delete unrequired files
rm Pan4551dataSambamba.bed Pan4551_duplicatesdata.bed Pan4551_duplicatesdataSambamba.bed
