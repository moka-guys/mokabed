# Pan4551
This is a BED file used to restrict variant calling within the exome depth CNV calling app. This BED file is for R229 Confirmed Fanconi anaemia or Bloom syndrome

This test consists of a number of genes, some of which had multiple transcripts.

Transcript was selected from the ngspanel genes table using the query
`select GuysAccession, Symbol, '0' as GuysAccessionVersion from ngspanelgenes where NGSPanelID=4551`
This was used to create Pan4551.txt and Pan4551_duplicates.txt, which ensured there was only transcript per gene. These were used as inputs to mokabed as below (and also Pan4551_duplicates_LogFile.txt):

## Combining multiple transcripts
Where multiple transcripts have been provided, the below BEDtools subtract command adds regions from file a not already covered in file b to the end of file b:

`bedtools subtract -a Pan4551_duplicatesdata.bed -b Pan4551data.bed >> Pan4551data.bed`
