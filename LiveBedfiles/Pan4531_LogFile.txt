Save Pan4531 request form and transcript file

Issues with making Pan4531:
1) Split genes with multiple transcripts into seperate transcript files (part1-2)
2) From previous attempts to make this file one transcript was found to cause a problem (SMN1) so will again be done manually.

#Combining multiple transcripts

1) Merge Pan4531_part1data.bed and Pan4531_part2data.bed
    bedtools subtract -a Pan4531_part2data.bed -b Pan4531_part1data.bed >> Pan4531_part1data.bed

2) Add regions from Pan4531_part1data.bed not included in Pan4531data.bed
    bedtools subtract -a Pan4531_part1data.bed -b Pan4531data.bed >> Pan4531data.bed

#Delete Pan4531_part1data.bed Pan4531_part2data.bed Pan4531_part1dataRefSeqFormat.txt Pan4531_part1dataSambamba.bed

#Problematic SMN1 transcript
Mokabed was failing because cruzdb was returning multiple records for the same transcript.
As described in Pan3973_log.md a number of steps were performed to extract the regions from the UCSC table browser

Pan3973_problemdata.bed file was downloaded from the git history at commit 982b443698 (https://github.com/moka-guys/mokabed/tree/982b443698683532c2a4a0032e0ae370742ad41a/LiveBedfiles)
Pan3973_problemdata.bed was saved as Pan4531_SMN1data.bed

#Add padding Pan4531_SMN1data.bed
Pan3973_problemdata.bed had +-10bp padding, to match the padding (30bp) in Pan4531data.bed regions were padded +-20bp further

#Add Pan4531_SMN1data.bed to Pan4531data.bed
cat Pan4531_SMN1data.bed >> Pan4531data.bed    There was no header to remove

##Remove Pan4531_SMN1data.bed
rm Pan4531_SMN1data.bed

##Add Pan3608
cat Pan3608.bed >> Pan4531data.bed

#Sort
sort Pan4531data.bed -k1,1V -k2,2n -k3,3n > Pan4531_sorted.bed

#Move header to the top in Pan4531_sorted.bed

#Rename files
mv Pan4531data.bed Pan4531_unsorted.bed; mv Pan4531_sorted.bed Pan4531data.bed
