#Challenges making this BED:
    - Genes with multiple transcripts - these must be combined without duplicating regions, using bedtools subtract. 
      To allow for this the transcript list (the mokaBED input) was split into 3 files Pan4531.txt, Pan4531_duplicates.txt, Pan4531_extra.txt
    - From previous attempts to make this file (Pan4531) one transcript was found to cause a problem (SMN1) so will again be done manually.

#Combining multiple transcripts

1) Merge Pan4531_extradata.bed and Pan4531_duplicatesdata.bed
    bedtools subtract -a Pan4531_extradata.bed -b Pan4531_duplicatesdata.bed >> Pan4531_duplicatesdata.bed
