# Pan4397
This BED file is used to calculate coverage for the VCP1 Panel. This was previously created in Pan4287, but a mistake was found in the mapping of one of the LAMA2 exons. Therefore, a copy of those files were made and manually edited.

The incorrect coordinates are:
incorrect coordinates - chr6:129763357-129763382
correct coordinates - chr6:129764197-129764223


## take copies of Pan4287data.bed and Pan4287dataSambamba.bed
`cp Pan4287data.bed Pan4397data.bed`
`cp Pan4287dataSambamba.bed Pan4397dataSambamba.bed`
