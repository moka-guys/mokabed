This is a VCP3 R90 test BED file for CNV analysis using ExomeDepth.

Things to be careful of when making this BED file:
1) Few genes had multiple transcripts they were split into different transcript files (Pan4571.txt, Pan4571_part1.txt, Pan4571_part2.txt, Pan4571_part3.txt)
2) DIAPH1 and NBEA exons mapped incorrectly in the UCSC- had to manually correct this.
