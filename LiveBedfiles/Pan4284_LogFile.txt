This BED file contains intronic variants for tests that will be analysed using VCP3 panel.

This is version 2 of this list of variants.

The coordinates for this BED file were provided by the monogenics team after consulting the Slice document provided by NHSE and with scientists in charge of these tests.

BED file request form saved in /RequestForms

The coordinates were manually converted into BED file 
The position quoted in the coordinates was used as the stop coord and the start pos was this coord -1.
These positions were then further padded +/-5bp
A check was performed to ensure all variants were SNVs (and no additional padding would be required)
Positions were checked in UCSC by adding the BED file as a track

Also checked for empty new line at end of file.

after checking the sizes of regions a mistake was seen in the MTM1 SNV at X:149831329. this was corrected
