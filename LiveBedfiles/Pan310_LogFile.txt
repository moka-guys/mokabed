#### Addition of  CNV MLPA and SNPcheck regions to bed file

CNV control sites and SNPcheck regions were manually added to the bed file.

1)
Both the CNV control sites and the SNP check regions were supplied by DNA lab in 1 based format. Therefore the sites needed to be translated to 0-based format which is compatible with inputting into a bed file.

Two separate text files one containing the CNV control sites and the other the SNPcheck regions were open as a spreadsheet in libre calc using colon (':') characters and dashes ('-) as delimiters in order to separate out chromosome, start and stop regions in the text file into separate columns.

eg text file shows genomic coordinates as chr:start-stop.

By setting the delimiters to colon and dash we can translate:

chr1:100001-102345
to

chr1	100001	102345

2)
Within the spreadsheet 1 was subtracted from each of the start position values in order to convert them to 0-based format

3)
Any lower case x values in the chromosome column were converted to upper case using a find replace of chrx for chrX

4)
Columns were re-fomatted so that the order of the columns in the text file read as:

Col number
1	2	3	4			5-13	14
#Chr	Start	Stop	TargetID/MLPAsite	Blank	-

5)
Text files were re-saved as bed files CNV_control_sites.bed and SNP_identity_check_sites.bed

6)
Coordinates in the two bed files CNV_control_sites.bed and SNP_identity_check_sites.bed were then appended to the Pan310NoCNV_NoSNPcheckdata.bed file and this new file is then saved as Pan310data.bed.

Appending these two files to Pan310NoCNV_NoSNPcheckdata.bed was performed by the following command

awk 'FNR==1 { while (/^#Chr/) getline; } { print }' /home/ryank/mokabed/LiveBedfiles/Pan310NoCNV_NoSNPcheckdata.bed /home/ryank/mokabed/LiveBedfiles/SNP_identity_check_sites.bed /home/ryank/mokabed/LiveBedfiles/CNV_control_sites.bed > /home/ryank/mokabed/LiveBedfiles/Pan310data.bed

7) Remove Pan310NoCNV_NoSNPcheckdata.bed

rm /home/ryank/mokabed/LiveBedfiles/Pan310NoCNV_NoSNPcheckdata.bed
