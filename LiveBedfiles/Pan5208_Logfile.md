## Pan5208
This VCP1 Exomedepth readcount BED file it is a remake of Pan5191. LDLR and PCSK9 were accidentally excluded from the bed file. Pan5206 will have up and down coding regions included and the 5UTR - no regions have been padded.

Additional regions were included in this BED file: 
Pan4291.bed- intronic variants relevant to Haematological genes 
Pan4290.bed- intronic variants for VCP1 regions 
Pan4292.bed- FH intronic variants padded by 5bp Pan4272.bed- intronic variants for CF 
Pan3608.bed- additional CNV regions
