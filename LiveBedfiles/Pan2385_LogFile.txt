# This bed file is the capture BED file for TWIST EXOME kit.
# Two files were provided by TWIST:
Twist_Exome_RefSeq_targets_hg19.bed - contains the kit with added refseq baits
Twist_Exome_Target_hg19.bed - contains the CCDS only

BEDtools intersect command (below) showed there were regions in the CCDS bedfile, not in the refseq bedfile.
bedtools intersect -v -a 'Twist_Exome_Target_hg19.bed' -b 'Twist_Exome_RefSeq_targets_hg19.bed

Therefore the BED files should be combined, sorted and merged:
cat Twist_Exome_RefSeq_targets_hg19.bed >> 'Twist_Exome_Target_hg19.bed'
