# Pan5164
This BEDfile is a subset of Pan3610 that is specific to R430. 
These regions were provided by Michael Yau and Lorraine Hawkes when requesting a BEDfile for the R430 exome depth CNV filtering stage.
Note this was previously made in Pan5157 but it incorrectly included RAD51D, which is not part of R430.
