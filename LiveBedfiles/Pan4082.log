This documents the generation of the Pan4082 (swift 57G) bed files.
These files are a slight modification of Pan3639, but where the bed file used to clip primers and the flattened BED file used for variant calling are adjusted to enable variants at the primer-amplicon border to be detected.

Therefore a copies of Pan3639.bed, Pan3639Sambamba.bed, Pan3639_PE.bed, and Pan3639_flat.bed were taken and renamed with Pan4082.
