This documents the generation of the Pan4768 bedfiles as requested in Pan4768_IKBKG_request_form.docx, the bedfile will be used to calculate coverage for the IKBKG gene in a long range PCR assay. 

I ran the SQL below in HeidiSQL query the MOKA backend:

select GuysAccession, Symbol, '0' as GuysAccessionVersion
from dbo.NGSPanelGenes
where NGSPanelID=4768

I exported this data into a file to called Pan4768.txt to use as input to Mokabed when creating teh bed file.  I saved the file to this repo.
