# Pan4550
This is a BED file used to restrict variant calling within the exome depth CNV calling app. This BED file is for R259 Nijmegen breakage CNV.

This test consists of a single gene/transcript.
The transcript was selected from the ngspanel genes table using the query
`select GuysAccession, Symbol, '0' as GuysAccessionVersion from ngspanelgenes where NGSPanelID=4550`
This was used to create Pan4550.txt, the inout to moka bed which was run as below:
