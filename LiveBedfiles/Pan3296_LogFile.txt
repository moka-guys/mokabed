Downloaded supplied file S0768212_Covered.bed and saved it to repo.

I manually edited the file to remove chr from the chromosome names using the regex ^chr.

I changed the name of the file to Pan3296data.bed so that it matches the pattern expected by the DNA Nexus app RPKM_bedfile:

 git mv S0768212_Covered.bed Pan3296data.bed

I uploaded this file to DNA nexus.
