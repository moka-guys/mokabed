# Pan5151

This BEDfile is a subset of Pan3610 that is specific to R207. These regions were provided by Michael Yau and Lorraine Hawkes within the BED file request form for R207 exome depth CNV filtering stage. This is included in this PR but might be deleted by the end so it can also be included when that BED file is made.

## Take a copy of Pan3610
`cp Pan3610.bed Pan5151.bed`

## manually remove unwanted regions
This was performed manually. There are 16 rows, matching the request form and the coordinates were checked. There is an empty new line at the end.
