# Pan5217

This is a remake of the VCP3 exomedepth readcount BEDfile.

During the validation of Pan5211_exomedepth.bed(https://github.com/moka-guys/mokabed/blob/master/LiveBedfiles/Pan5211_exomedepth.bed) it was noticed CARS1 gene was missing.

The process of generating a VCP3 Exomedepth readcount bedfile is very complicated, the quickest solution to this problem without restarting from scratch, was to create the CARS1 bedfile seperately and join the output with Pan5211 creating Pan5217_exomedepth.bed
