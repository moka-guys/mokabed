This BED file is a remake of Pan4948, the VCP2 +/-10bp panel, but with the following changes:
- whole of SCG5 gene,
- 6 genomic targets that lie between SCG5 and GREM1 (Pan5117)
- extra UTR regions (Pan5120)
- updated trancript of POLD1 gene to NM_002691

## Save transcripts
PTEN gene included separetly as it also requires the 5' UTR (also padded 10bp).
