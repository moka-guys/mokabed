This is a VCP1 R134 test BED file for CNV analysis using ExomeDepth. No padding was been added to the exons and 5UTR has been included.

**NOTE**: 5UTRS were requested to be padded by 30bp to capture CNVs extending beyond the 5UTR. However, Exomedepth reports full length of any CNV overlapping with any region given in the bedfile, therefore there is no value padding the 5UTR.
