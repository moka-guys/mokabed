## Pan5018
This BED file will be used to calculate coverage for the 4 genes currently targetted by the LRPCR assay (as per Pan4967)

As described in Pan4971 this transcript of SMN1 cuases issues with MokeBED so in this case the SMN1 gene will be added by concatenating the existing Pan4971 BED files.
