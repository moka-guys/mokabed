This BED file contains intronic variants for CF that will be analysed using VCP1 panel.

This is version 1 of this list of variants.

The coordinates for this BED file were provided by the monogenics team after consulting the Slice document provided by NHSE and with scientists in charge of these tests.

BED file request form saved in /RequestForms

The coordinates were manually converted into BED file 
The position quoted in the coordinates was used as the stop coord and the start pos was this coord -1.
The deletion rs397508809 is a 4bp therefore the start pos was not substracted by -1
These positions were then further padded +/-5bp
Positions were checked in UCSC by adding the BED file as a track

Also checked for empty new line at end of file.
