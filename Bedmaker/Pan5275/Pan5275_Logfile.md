## Pan5275

CP2v2 Whole Capture BED file (build37) for coverage and variant calling.

Some additional genes were requested in CPv2, the additional genes and transcripts were provided by Heidi K.

Files used to create the original CP2 variant calling bedfiles (Pan5230 and Pan5232) were re-used to for Pan5275, however Pan5232_CP2_transcripts.txt was updated to include the new genes.
