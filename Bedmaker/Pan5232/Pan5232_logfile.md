## Pan5232

CP2 Whole Capture BED file (build37) for coverage and variant calling.
There was an issue with the original CP2 bedfile Pan5230, so the bedfile had to be remade. The incorrect transcript was provided for the gene ABHD5, in Pan5232 the transcript was corrected to NM_016006.4 from NM_016006.4 (ABHD6 transcript). The correct transcript was provided by Heidi K.
