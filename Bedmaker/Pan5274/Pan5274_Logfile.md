## Pan5274

CP2 CNV calling BED file (build37) for exomedepth CNV caller step. This is to modify already generated R79 CNV bed file since a gene need to be removed.

# Request form for R74
The new request form Pan5274_R79_bedrequest.txt added into mokabed/LiveBedfiles/RequestForms

Request form was originally named as Pan5270 when sent from the Scientist, and it was renamed from Pan5270 to Pan5274. 

Changes requested in the new request form.
- removed COL4A1 from R79 bed file
- rename ISPD to CRPPA and TMEM5 to RXYLT1 in R79 bed (this is not necessary to do as the regions in bed file are generated by transcripts not by the gene name)
NOTE: genes names specified in the form may not match the gene names in the bedfile as transcript numbers are used to create the bedfiles

# Copy previously generated R79 bed file
Copied Previously generated R79 bed file (i.e. Pan5254_CNV.bed) and renamed this bed file as Pan5274_CNV.bed. 

# Deleting COL4A1 gene from bed file
All regions for COL4A1 are removed from the bed file.

# testing
Pan5274_CNV.bed was tested in DNAnexus (003_250304_CP2_exomedepth_bedfiles) using ED_cnv_calling_v1.4.0. The app completed successfully without any error.
