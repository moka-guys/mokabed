## Pan5274

CP2 CNV calling BED file (build37) for exomedepth CNV caller step. This is to modify already generated R79 CNV bed file since some genes need to be removed.

# Request form for R74
The new request form Pan5274_R79_bedrequest.txt added into mokabed/LiveBedfiles/RequestForms

Request form was originally named as Pan5270 when sent from the Scientist, and it was renamed from Pan5270 to Pan5274. 

Changes requested in the new request form.
- removed COL4A1 from R79 bed file
- rename ISPD to CRPPA and TMEM5 to RXYLT1 in R79 bed (this is not necessary to do as the be regions in bed file are generated by transcripts not by the gene name)
NOTE: genes names specified in the form may not match the gene names in the bedfile as transcript numbers are used to create the bedfiles

# Copy previously generated R74 bed file
Copied Previously generated R74 bed file (i.e. Pan5254_CNV.bed) and renamed this bed file as Pan5274_CNV.bed.
