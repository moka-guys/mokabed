## Pan5273

CP2 CNV calling BED file (build37) for exomedepth CNV caller step. This is to modify already generated R81 CNV bed file since a gene needs to be removed.

# Request form for R81
The new request form Pan5273_R81_bedrequest.txt added into mokabed/LiveBedfiles/RequestForms

Request form was originally named as Pan5271 when sent from the Scientist, and it was renamed from Pan5271 to Pan5273. 

Changes requested in the new request form.
- remove CCDC78 from R81 bed file
- rename ADSSL1 to ADSS1 on R81 (this is not necessary to do as the regions in bed file are generated by transcripts not by the gene name)
NOTE: genes names specified in the form may not match the gene names in the bedfile as transcript numbers are used to create the bedfiles

# Copy previously generated R81 bed file
Copied Previously generated R81 bed file (i.e. Pan5253_CNV.bed) and renamed this bed file as Pan5273_CNV.bed. 

# remove gene
Delete CCDC78 gene regions from the bed file
