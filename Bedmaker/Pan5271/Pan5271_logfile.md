# Pan5271
CP2 Whole Capture BED file (build37) for coverage and variant calling.
It is a copy of Pan5239, a few issues were noted in the Pan5239_readcount.bed:
1) Bedmaker assigned NM transcripts as gene name for certain genes.
2) The additional "_" in the region labels, caused an error to be printed on ED reports.
